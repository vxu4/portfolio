    <p> Goal: Create an online zine for an interdisciplinary Brown/RISD collective, <a href = "https://discover-artsci.space"> Discover</a>. This collective seeks to blur boundaries between disciplines and encourage dialogue, creativity, and discussions across fields and institutions. The group hosts biweekly discussion series, exhibitions, and an annual conference.

    <p> This zine serves as a platform for students and members to share thoughts, projects, and events. For the zine, I used react to simultaneously filter on type of content, person the content is by, and sort by date. This way, the content is both searchable and friendly to browsing.
