    <p> Goal: Redesign an existing startup's user interface. We chose the startup ShopWith, whose goal is to let shoppers browse their favorite products and brands used by social media influencers.  We are choosing to design this as a mobile app because the social media influencers are already creating their brands on mobile apps anyway, and this will work complementary to that. Additionally, the shoppers are people who follow the influencers on social media, so we know they also use their phone for social media apps and would most likely be willing to add one more.

    <p>	In designing the hi-fi version of Sketch 4, we took into heavy consideration learnability. memorability, and efficiency. To make sure it was learnable and memorable, we wanted the structure of the app to be simple, seek, and logical. As a result, we made sure to implement a menu with routes to all the pages. We also decided to implement a feed page, which would be familiar to the target user audience of the app: fans of youtubers, bloggers, and instagrammers looking to keep up with their favorite fashion and lifestyle icons. </p>

  <table>
  <tr>
    <td style = "background-color: #4671EE; opacity: 0.6; color:white;font-size: 20px;">Home Page</td>
    <td>The user was drawn to the content post which was eye-catching with bright colors and a bold font. This was in-line with our original hypothesis, as we believed brightly colored content against a bare minimalist interface background would draw in the user’s attention.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style = "color: #4671EE; font-size: 20px;">Influencer Profile Page</td>
    <td> The user’s eyes are first drawn to the influencer’s profile picture,  since it is partitioned with a circle outline, which contrasts with the rest of the interface’s rectangular outlines. After her gaze is drawn up to the bold matte colors of the influencer’s banner photo, and then moves downwards to the bio. This explains how most of the heatmap is concentrated on the profile picture and the area above and below it.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style = "background-color: #4671EE; opacity: 0.6; color:white;font-size: 20px;">Feed Page</td>
    <td>After the user clicks on the feed, she realizes that it is not the correct page to complete her given task (buying the chanel No. 5 perfume), so she immediately searches for a link that will take her to the correct page, which is why most of the heatmap is concentrated around the products button.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style = "color: #4671EE; font-size: 20px; ">Influencer’s Products Page</td>
    <td>Since the Chanel No. 5 perfume is the first product and also the one for the given task, most of the heatmap is concentrated around that area.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style = "background-color: #4671EE; opacity: 0.6; color:white;font-size: 20px;">Product Page</td>
    <td>We believe there was the most confusion on this page. The user’s heatmap is divided between the heart icon on the upper right-hand corner of the product and the add to cart option. This is most likely because there is no intuitive indication to what the heart icon does, and if its function is different from the add to cart button.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style = "color: #4671EE; font-size: 20px; ">Cart</td>
    <td>The user’s heatmap is relatively scattered on this page, since she has completed the task assigned to her and is unsure how to proceed, since no further instructions were given after telling her to add the perfume to her cart.
    </td>
  </tr>
